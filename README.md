Welcome to Unitree Go2 Simulation repository for Isaac-Sim(4.5.0) and IsaacLab(2.1.0). This repository has been updated to make use of latest Nvidia libraries using [Migration Guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/migration/migrating_from_orbit.html) and tested on multiple devices.

## 1. Installation Guide
**Step I:** Please follow the [Isaac Lab official documentation](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html) to install the latest Isaac Sim and Isaac Lab

**Step II:** Please install [ROS2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) with the official installation guide.

**Step III:** Install the prerequisite C extension in the conda environment.
```
# Assuming you are using default conda env name from IsaacLab (env_isaaclab)
conda activate env_isaaclab     
conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng
```

**Step IV:** Clone this repo to your local directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/sallu-786/Go2_Isaac_ros2/
```

## 2. Run Unitree Go2 Simulation 
To run the simulation, please use the following command:
```
cd ~/Go2_Isaac_ros2
python main.py
```
Once the simulation is loaded, the robot can be teleoperated by the keyboard:

```W```: Forward, ```A```: Left, ```S```: Backward, ```D```: Right, ```Z```: Left Turn, ```C```: Right Turn.

To set your own custom keys make changes in ```go2/go2_ctrl.py```

## 3. ROS2 Topics and Visualization
After launching the simulation, Open a new terminal and visualize the ROS2 data in ```Rviz2```:
```
cd ~/Go2_Isaac_ros2/rviz/
rviz2
```
If you dont see anything click add button and from topic list select topic you want to visualize. For example to view camera image ```Add-->Camera-->Image
![rviz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/946b6a31-b52a-4153-b337-846087fc2b7d)

Here is a categorized list of ROS 2 topics available for the Unitree Go2:

**Command and Control**  
- `/unitree_go2/cmd_vel`:  Topic to send velocity commands to the robot for motion control.

**Front Camera**  
- `/unitree_go2/front_cam/color_image`: Publishes RGB color images captured by the front camera.
- `/unitree_go2/front_cam/depth_image`: Publishes depth images from the front camera.
- `unitree_go2/front_cam/semantic_segmentation_image`: Publishes semantic segmentation images from the front camera.
- `/unitree_go2/front_cam/info`: Publishes camera information, including intrinsic parameters.

**LIDAR**  
- `/unitree_go2/lidar/point_cloud`:  Publishes a point cloud generated by the robot's LIDAR sensor.

**Odometry and Localization**  
- `/unitree_go2/odom`:  Publishes odometry data, including the robot's position, orientation, and velocity.
- `/unitree_go2/pose`:  Publishes the current pose of the robot in the world frame.


## 4. Simulation Environments & settings
The simulation environments and settings can be changed in ```isaac-go2-ros2/cfg/sim.yaml``` config file. 

#### Launch different simulation environments
The current implementation contains a few environments which follows standard Isaac Sim method for importing USD environments(from cloud). To change the environment, please change the ```env_name``` in  ```isaac-go2-ros2/cfg/sim.yaml```. Current available environments:
- ```warehouse```: A simple warehouse environment in Isaac Sim. (for further options in warehouse category, change path value in ```create_warehouse_env()``` function inside ```env/sim_env.py```)
- ```obstacle```: An obstacle field environment.  (change value of variable ```num_obstacles``` inside ```env/sim_env.py``` to make it dense or sparse)
- ```terrain```: A Terrain environment in Isaac Sim. (for further options in terrain category, change path value in ```create_terrain_env()``` function inside ```env/sim_env.py```)
- ```office```
- ```hospital```
- ```rivermark```

As of now there are 70 environments assets available in isaac-sim 4.5.0. see more at [Environment Assets](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/4.5.0/assets/usd_assets_environments.html)
  
#### Launch different Policy/Algorithms 
To Launch Policy other than default (```ActorCritic```), go to```go2/go2_ctrl_cfg.py``` and use any of the following values 
  - ```ActorCriticRecurrent```
  - ```StudentTeacher```
  - ```StudentTeacherRecurrent```

Algorithm by default is ```PPO``` you may also use ```Distillation```. For compatibility check and more details, please visit [API_docs](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/api/lab_rl/isaaclab_rl.html)

**Load custom checkpoints**

Pretrained model (policy files) for flat and rough terrain are available in ```ckpts/unitee_go2``` folder. If you want to load your own policy, place the file in the folder and change the value for 'load_checkpoint' in ```go2/go2_ctrl_cfg.py```.

#### Launch multiple robots in the environment
This repository supports running multiple Unitree Go2 robots and the number of robots can by changed by the ```num_envs``` parameter in the config file ```isaac-go2-ros2/cfg/sim.yaml```. The following shows an example video.

## 5. Example Usage
The video shows an example of using this repo with an [RL agent](https://github.com/Zhefan-Xu/NavRL) to achieve navigation and collision avoidance:
